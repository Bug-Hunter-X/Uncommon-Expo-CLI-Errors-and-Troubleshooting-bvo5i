# Uncommon Expo CLI Errors and Troubleshooting

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered while using the Expo CLI and provides solutions.

## Problem Description
The Expo CLI can sometimes throw cryptic errors, especially when dealing with version mismatches between Expo Go, Expo CLI, and project dependencies, or when there are conflicts in the project configuration.  These errors aren't as common as typical build or dependency errors but can be particularly frustrating to debug.

## Reproduction Steps

The `expoBug.js` file simulates a scenario where an outdated Expo CLI version or conflicting dependencies might cause unexpected behavior.  This might require some setup to reproduce exactly (like a specific Expo SDK version causing conflicts).  The solution will focus on strategies to diagnose and address such situations rather than a fixed reproduction.

## Solution
The `expoBugSolution.js` file shows how to approach this kind of error.  The focus is on:

* **Checking Expo CLI and Expo Go versions:** Using `expo --version` and ensuring both are updated.
* **Inspecting package.json:** Examining the dependencies and devDependencies to ensure compatibility and removing or updating conflicting packages.
* **Cleaning the project:** Running `expo prebuild` or deleting the `.expo` and `node_modules` folders then reinstalling dependencies.
* **Checking Expo SDK version:** Verify the SDK version is compatible with the libraries and features used.
* **Looking at Expo documentation:** This is crucial for verifying compatibility.

Remember that error messages for these types of problems may vary, requiring careful investigation to pinpoint the source of the issue.
