This error typically occurs when you're using a library or feature that requires a specific version of Expo Go or Expo CLI, but your current version doesn't meet the requirements.  It can also manifest if there's a mismatch between your project's configuration and the actual Expo Go or CLI installation.  The error message itself is often vague, making it difficult to pinpoint the exact cause.
